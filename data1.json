        "I am a 24 years old male. I had an unprotected sexual intercourse with a female in Chile two years ago. Three weeks later : fever for a day or two followed by an oral thrush. 6 weeks later : explosive diarrhea, fever for about 5 days. Maybe i should mention that I had an extreme food poisoning two weeks before my exposure during a trip in Bolivia. Few months after, I had a recurring pain in the left knee (still painful sometimes). A year after the exposure, I had something like kidney stones (pain, etc) but echography did not show anything. Bloodwork showed elevated TSH though (hypothyroidism, which is uncommon for someone my age). Right now, my symptoms are: a lot of blood in stool (for a few months now), constipation, dry skin, extreme fatigue, alcohol intolerance, extreme dandruff, white tongue, recurring hairline spots in my neck, chest pain (I think there are more). I have been of course tested for HIV multiple times up to 18 months post exposure. I don't know what's wrong with my body. what do you guys think? lyme ? any retroviruses ?"

They don't cause me any pain and since I found them I really haven't paid much attention to them until now. To be sure, I had a full blood and urine scans and everything came back perfectly fine.
